# National Killings by Police

This project is aimed at investigating:
1) The role that racism plays in the way BIPOC who are killed by police are ‘coded’ in terms of armed status.
2) To investigate the relationship between city police spending and city police killings, especially of BIPOC.


EDA

I spent most of time doing EDA of my second dataframe, which was a merger of the Mapping Police Violence dataset on '2019-2019 Killings by PD' and the Lincoln Institute's 2013-2019 data on city budgets. In total, there were 78 cities represented in the dataset, based on which cities had police killings that had been reported on from 2013-2019.

Reflection


Even though I was unable to reject my null hypothesis that the ratios of unarmed killed who are BIPOC and unarmed killed who are white are the same, I still enjoyed the research and skill building that this project involved. I was able to deepen my Pandas knowledge 
If I have time, I'd like to merge this data set with a data set showing the police budget by department and plot numbers of killings of unarmed BIPOC as a function of police budgets, hoping to prove that larger budgets lead to more murders.
