# national-killings-by-police

I want to prove that more unarmed BIPOC/non-white people are killed by police than unarmed white folx by a significant margin.

I also would like to show that BIPOC are more likely to be labeled "allegedly armed" than white folx.

STEPS TO TAKE:
1) Import data
2) Clean and sort data
3) Hypothesis testing

If I have time, I'd like to merge this data set with a data set showing the police budget by department and plot numbers of killings of unarmed BIPOC as a function of police budgets, hoping to prove that larger budgets lead to more murders.
