# national-killings-by-police

I want to prove that more unarmed BIPOC/non-white people are killed by police than unarmed white folx by a significant margin.

I also would like to show that BIPOC are more likely to be labeled "allegedly armed" than white folx.

STEPS TO TAKE:
1) Import data
2) Clean and sort data
3) Hypothesis testing

If I have time, I'd like to merge this data set with a data set showing the police budget by department and plot numbers of killings of unarmed BIPOC as a function of police budgets, hoping to prove that larger budgets lead to more murders.

CONCLUSION 1: BIPOC more likely to be labeled 'allegedly armed' than white folx.
1) Drop armed (or whatever makes the most sense)
2) Calculate rations of all. armed vs. total killed for white folx and BIPOC
3) Do a z-test with null hypothesis saying ratio of labeling BIPOC as 'allegedly armed'  = ratio of labeling white folx as 'allegedly armed'

CONCLUSION 2: unarmed BIPOC more likely to be killed than unarmed white folx.

CONCLUSION 3: the higher a city's police spending, the higher the number of police killings of BIPOC.
